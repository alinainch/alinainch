I am a full stack software engineer focused on web development. As an Afro-Latina immigrant, I am fluent in Spanish and English, which helps me communicate effectively with diverse clients and colleagues.

I can deliver optimal solutions to complex problems while ensuring effective communication with clients. My ability to collaborate and deliver high-quality results on time and on budget makes me an asset to my team. I stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices to deliver outcomes. My experience as a web developer equipped me with technical skills in HTML5, CSS, Node.js, React, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Object Oriented Java Programming.
